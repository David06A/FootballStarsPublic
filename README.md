AVAILABILITY
The Footballing Stars bot runs on fast state of the art servers, but it is still possible there will be small delays. We can not guarantee an uptime of 100% but it will be near 100%.

LINKS IN MESSAGES SENT BY THE BOT
When sending live notifications the bot adds buttons and links to the website https://twitter.com/David06A_, which is owned by the creators of the Footballing Stars bot. The links are added for convenience as Discord has limits to how much information can be shown.

DISCLAIMER
You can use the bot as is. The basic funtionality is free. There will be a premium feature in the future. We do not guarantee that everything that is now freely available will remain free in the future. We do not guarantee the continuity of the bot in the long run as we are dependend on the data provided by our partner. But we will do everything possible to deliver superfast notifications and quality data. The bot is daily updated for bug fixes and new features.
